    "## [Completing a Tree]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "An undirected graph is connected if there is a path connecting any two nodes. A tree is a connected (undirected) graph containing no cycles; this definition forces the tree to have a branching structure organized around a central core of nodes, just like its living counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the creation of a phylogeny, taxa are encoded by the tree's leaves, or nodes having degree 1. A node of a tree having degree larger than 1 is called an internal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "**Given:** A positive integer `n`, where `n â‰¤ 1000`, and an adjacency list corresponding to a graph on `n` nodes that contains no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return:** The minimum number of edges that can be added to the graph to produce a tree.\n",
    "\n",
