    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "**Probability** is the mathematical study of randomly occurring phenomena. We will model such a phenomenon with a random variable, which is simply a variable that can take a number of different distinct outcomes depending on the result of an underlying random process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say that we have a bag containing 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. If we let X represent the random variable corresponding to the color of a drawn ball, then the probability of each of the two outcomes is given by Pr(X=red) = 3 / 5 and Pr(X=blue) = 2 / 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event is simply a collection of outcomes. Because outcomes are distinct, the probability of an event can be written as the sum of the probabilities of its constituent outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "**Given:** Three positive integers `k`, `m`, and `n`, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms: `k` individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, `m` are heterozygous, and `n` are homozygous recessive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return:** The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.\n",
