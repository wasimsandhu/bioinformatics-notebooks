    "## [Genome Assembly as Shortest Superstring](https://rosalind.info/problems/long/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Recall from “Computing GC Content” that almost all humans share approximately 99.9% of the same nucleotides on the genome. Thus, if we know only a few complete genomes from the species, then we already possess an important key to unlocking the species genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining an organism's complete genome (called genome sequencing) forms a central task of bioinformatics. Unfortunately, we still don't possess the microscope technology to zoom into the nucleotide level and determine the sequence of a genome's nucleotides, one at a time. However, researchers can apply chemical methods to generate and identify much smaller snippets of DNA, called reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining a large collection of reads from multiple copies of the same genome, the aim is to reconstruct the desired genome from these small pieces of DNA; this process is called fragment assembly. **Fragment assembly** works by blasting many copies of the same genome into smaller, identifiable reads, which are then used to computationally assemble one copy of the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "For a collection of strings, a larger string containing every one of the smaller strings as a substring is called a **superstring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the assumption of parsimony, a shortest possible superstring over a collection of reads serves as a candidate chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:** At most 50 DNA strings of approximately equal length, not exceeding 1 kbp, in FASTA format (which represent reads deriving from the same strand of a single linear chromosome).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset is guaranteed to satisfy the following condition: there exists a unique way to reconstruct the entire chromosome from these reads by gluing together pairs of reads that overlap by more than half their length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return:** A shortest superstring containing all the given strings (thus corresponding to a reconstructed chromosome).\n",
    "\n",
